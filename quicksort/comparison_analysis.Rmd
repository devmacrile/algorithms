"Quick comparison" of QuickSort comparison counts for three different median selections:  

* Always choose the first element  
* Always choose the second element
* The median-of-three pivot rule  

What is the *median-of-three pivot* rule?  Explanation from [Tim Roughgarden](http://theory.stanford.edu/~tim/):  

> In more detail, you should choose the pivot as follows. Consider the first, middle, and final elements of the given array. (If the array has odd length it should be clear what the "middle" element is; for an array with even length 2k, use the kth element as the "middle" element. So for the array 4 5 6 7, the "middle" element is the second one ---- 5 and not 6!) Identify which of these three elements is the median (i.e., the one whose value is in between the other two), and use this as your pivot

```{r}
library(reshape2)
library(ggplot2)
res <- read.csv('data/results.csv')
res <- cbind(res[,1],
             colsplit(as.character(res[,2]), ",", 
                      c("first", "last", "medof3")))
colnames(res)[1] <- "length"
res <- res[order(res[,1]), ]
summary(res)

ggplot(res) + 
  geom_line(aes(length, first, colour="First")) + 
  geom_line(aes(length, last, colour="Last")) +
  geom_line(aes(length, medof3, colour="Median-of-three")) +
  geom_line(aes(length, length*log(length), colour="Nlog(N)")) + 
  scale_colour_discrete(name = "Pivot") +
  ggtitle("QuickSort: Comparison Counts by Pivot Choice") +
  xlab("Input Array Length") + ylab("Comparisons") +
  labs(linetype='Pivot')
 
ggplot(res) + 
  geom_line(aes(length, first - medof3, colour="First")) +
  geom_line(aes(length, last - medof3, colour="Last")) +
  scale_colour_discrete(name = "") +
  ggtitle("Difference betwen Median-of-three and First/Last") +
  xlab("Input Array Length") + ylab("Difference in Comparisons")
